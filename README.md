## 🚧 Development Journey

> This app was built with a mix of curiosity, stubbornness, and a whole lot of late-night caffeine-fueled problem solving.  
> Even though React Native was new to me, I pushed through multiple iterations — switching workflows, debugging weird issues, and learning tools like Notifee just to get **that one feature** working.  
> It’s not perfect, but it’s something that enabled me to push more.
